# Bluetooth H4 Broadcom Wireshark plugin from the InternalBlue project

This dissector contains vendor specific additions to the serial protocol
H4, which is used by the operating system's driver to interact with
Bluetooth chips. Broadcom not only supports sending standard messages
such as HCI commands and events but also has an undocumented
diagnostic protocol using the H4 serial data type 0x07.
